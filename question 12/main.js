//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["sana", "sobia", "hamna", "hadiya", "hina",];
//for loop method
for (var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log("Hello ,".concat(names[i], " !how are you today?"));
}
